    <p>Some things I would love to create:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a website</li>
      <li>an app</li>
      <li>a game</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I created a main title by adding a heading element above the embedded image. I moved the paragraph element below the image, then added another
      paragraph element with an unordered list and a link inside of it. I am now realizing that I probably did not need to add another 'p' element. 
      Oh well. We are learning!
